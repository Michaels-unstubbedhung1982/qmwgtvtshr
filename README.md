Omg, just finished The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, and honestly, what even was that? Like, seriously. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m all for epic adventures and monster fights, but that storyline was all over the place! One minute it’s underwater chaos, and the next it’s land drama. Sometimes I just wonder if they pull plots outta a hat or something, haha.

And don’t even get me started on Geralt's mysterious underwater breathing skills now. Is this a new potion or something? I was like, okay, sure guys, whatever you say. But hey, the visuals were freaking cool though, all those sirens and stuff. Could almost make me wanna download the movie just to pause and gawk at all the CGI madness.

> So there’s this random subplot with Yennefer that just felt... there? Like, okay, she’s off doing some spell stuff, meanwhile everyone else is fighting for their life. The whole magic bit seemed like filler, you know what I mean? It’s like, either give her a proper arc or don’t, omg.

Anyway, I’m a sucker for Jaskier’s songs. That dude’s hilarious, and props to him for trying to hold it all together with some tunes. And oh man, the pacing was so whack. Three different climaxes and no idea what I was supposed to feel. Like, guys, make up your mind!

I legit thought halfway through like, did I need to watch the movie more than once just to get everything? So many faces to keep track of, jeez. But when those sirens started their creepy song thing? Chills, but also just kinda over it? Weird combo, I know lol.

Okay, enough ranting from me. Guess it's one of those things that’s good for a “watch with friends” night just for the laughs. Can’t say it’s perfect, but it’s something, right? Ugh, need sleep now before my head explodes from all that madness. Talk soon!
